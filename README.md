Code Sources:

The code in this project was primarily created using concepts learned from the course curriculum, class activities, and assignments. When I encountered issues or needed clarification, I used ChatGPT to help debug the code and better understand specific parts of the assignment. All coding contributions are based on the knowledge gained through this course and support provided.
